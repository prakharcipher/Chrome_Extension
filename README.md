# HTML-Slate
A Google Chrome Extension to quick edit your HTML5 with so hustle of typing tags and syntax. The popup slate is programmed to detect all the syntax and autocomplete it as you type the initials.

## How to install -

1) Clone the repository.

2) Copy all the files to a separate folder.

3) Go to Google Chrome -> Tools -> Extensions.

4) Select "Load unpacked extension" and upload the folder.

5) Reload the page and you've got it.

### Note

As and when you write HTML in the slate, you can auto-indent and beautify it just by clicking 'alt' button (or 'option' in Mac).
